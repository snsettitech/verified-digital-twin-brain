# Roadmap: Verified Digital Twin Brain

This roadmap outlines the evolution of the Verified Digital Twin Brain platform, moving from a grounded Q&A engine to a fully autonomous, accountable agent.

## Current Progress: Phase 1 (MVP) - Grounded Answers
**Status: Completed**

- [x] Multi-tenant database schema (Supabase).
- [x] Document ingestion pipeline (PDF extraction -> Chunking -> OpenAI Embeddings -> Pinecone).
- [x] RAG-based chat API with citation support.
- [x] Confidence-based escalation logic.
- [x] Basic Next.js dashboard and chat interface.

## Next Milestone: Phase 2 - Cloud Agents & Verified Memory
**Status: Completed**

The goal is to move from a local Q&A script to a **live, agentic cloud brain** that can reason and verify knowledge.

- [x] **Cloud Migration readiness**: Added `Procfile` and `railway.json` for cloud deployment.
- [x] **Agentic Reasoning Loop**: Transitioned from static RAG to a dynamic LangGraph reasoning loop.
- [x] **Verified Memory Injection**: Implemented logic to turn owner's manual responses into high-priority vector embeddings.
- [x] **Early Tool Framework**: Established `modules/tools.py` architecture for future cloud tool expansion.
- [x] **Advanced Reranking**: Implement a re-ranking layer (Cohere/BGE) to improve retrieval precision.
- [x] **Owner Escalation Inbox**: UI for owners to view and resolve low-confidence questions.
- [x] **Twin Personalization**: System instructions and basic persona configuration.

## Future Milestone: Phase 3 - Digital Persona & Multi-Modal Mind
**Status: Planned (Pivoting to Delphi-style Architecture)**

Moving from a basic RAG bot to a high-fidelity digital mind that clones the owner's knowledge and style.

- [ ] **HyDE & Query Expansion**: Generate hypothetical answers to improve vector search depth.
- [ ] **Context Enrichment**: Ingest documents with hypothetical questions and opinion/fact metadata tags.
- [ ] **Multi-Modal Ingestion**: Scrapers for YouTube transcripts, Podcast audio (Whisper), and Social Media (Twitter/X threads).
- [ ] **Persona Encoding**: Analysis of owner's writing style, common phrases, and opinion vectors for high-fidelity responses.
- [ ] **Omni-channel Presence**: Development of embeddable web widgets and API for third-party integration (Delphi-style).
- [ ] **Advanced Namespace Isolation**: Implementing robust multi-tenant isolation via Pinecone namespaces.

## Strategic Milestone: Phase 4 - Autonomous Action & Accountability
**Status: Research**

Full delegation within scoped permissions and rigorous audit trails.

- [ ] **Self-Correction Loop**: Implement an agentic verification node to check answers against citations for hallucination prevention.
- [ ] **Live App Integration**: Connect real-world tools (Gmail, Slack, Calendar) via Composio for active work.
- [ ] **Autonomous Drafting**: AI handles complex requests and drafts responses across apps for owner approval.
- [ ] **Policy Enforcement**: Define granular rules for what the twin can and cannot do autonomously.
- [ ] **Full Auditability**: Immutable log of every decision, source used, and action taken by the twin.

## Long-term Vision: Phase 5 - Scale & Ecosystem
**Status: Visionary**

Expanding the digital footprint and making the twin omnipresent.

- [ ] **Multi-Modal Ingestion**: "Scrape" digital footprints including YouTube transcripts, Twitter threads, and Podcast audio (Whisper).
- [ ] **Persona & Voice Cloning**: Advanced style-matching and ElevenLabs voice cloning to match the owner's identity perfectly.
- [ ] **Omni-channel Distribution**: Deploy twins via WhatsApp, SMS, and embeddable web widgets.
- [ ] **Enterprise Scale**: High-availability infrastructure for thousands of concurrent digital minds.
